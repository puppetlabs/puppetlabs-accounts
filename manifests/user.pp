# @summary
#   This resource manages the user, group, vim/, .ssh/, .bash_profile, .bashrc,
#   homedir, .ssh/authorized_keys files, and directories.
#
# @example Basic usage
#   accounts::user { 'bob':
#     uid      => '4001',
#     gid      => '4001',
#     group    => 'staff',
#     shell    => '/bin/bash',
#     password => '!!',
#     locked   => false,
#   }
#
# @param ensure
#   Specifies whether the user, its primary group, homedir, and ssh keys should
#   exist. Valid values are 'present' and 'absent'. Note that when a user is
#   created, a group with the same name as the user is also created.
#
# @param allowdupe
#   Whether to allow duplicate UIDs. By default false
#
# @param bash_profile_content
#   The content to place in the user's ~/.bash_profile file. Mutually exclusive
#   to bash_profile_source.
#
# @param bash_profile_source
#   A source file containing the content to place in the user's ~/.bash_profile
#   file. Mutually exclusive to bash_profile_content.
#
# @param bashrc_content
#   The content to place in the user's ~/.bashrc file. Mutually exclusive to
#   bashrc_source.
#
# @param bashrc_source
#   A source file containing the content to place in the user's ~/.bashrc file.
#   Mutually exclusive to bashrc_content.
#
# @param comment
#   A comment describing or regarding the user.
#
# @param create_group
#   Specifies if you want to create a group with the user's name.
#
# @param expiry
#   Specifies the date the user account expires on. Valid values: YYYY-MM-DD
#   date format, or 'absent' to remove expiry date.
#
# @param forcelocal
#   Specifies whether you want to manage a local user/group that is also managed
#   by a network name service.
#
# @param forward_content
#   The content to place in the user's ~/.forward file. Mutually exclusive to
#   forward_source.
#
# @param forward_source
#   A source file containing the content to place in the user's ~/.forward file.
#   Mutually exclusive to forward_content.
#
# @param gid
#   Specifies the gid of the user's primary group. Must be specified
#   numerically.
#
# @param group
#   Specifies the name of the user's primary group. By default, this uses a
#   group named the same as user name
#
# @param groups
#   Specifies the user's group memberships.
#
# @param home
#   Specifies the path to the user's home directory.
#
#   - Linux, non-root user: '/home/$name'
#
#   - Linux, root user: '/root'
#
#   - Solaris, non-root user: '/export/home/$name'
#
#   - Solaris, root user: '/'
#
# @param home_mode
#   Manages the user's home directory permission mode. Valid values are in octal
#   notation, specified as a string. Defaults to undef, which creates a home
#   directory with 0700 permissions. It does not touch them if the directory
#   already exists. Keeping it undef also allows a user to manage their own
#   permissions. If home_mode is set, Puppet enforces the permissions on every
#   run.
#
# @param ignore_password_if_empty
#   Specifies whether an empty password attribute should be ignored. If set to true,
#   a password attribute that is defined but set to the empty string is ignored,
#   allowing the password to be managed outside of this Puppet module. If set to false,
#   it sets the password to an empty value.
#
# @param iterations
#   This is the number of iterations of a chained computation of the PBKDF2
#   password hash. This field is required for managing passwords on OS X >=
#   10.8.
#
# @param locked
#   Specifies whether the account should be locked and the user prevented from
#   logging in. Set to true for users whose login privileges have been revoked.
#
# @param managehome
#   Specifies whether the user's home directory should be created when adding a
#   user.
#
# @param managevim
#   Specifies whether or not the .vim folder should be created within the
#   managed accounts home directory.
#
# @param membership
#   Establishes whether specified groups should be considered the complete list
#   (inclusive) or the minimum list (minimum) of groups to which the user
#   belongs. Valid values: 'inclusive', 'minimum'.
#
# @param name
#   Name of the user.
#
# @param password
#   The user's password, in whatever encrypted format the local machine
#   requires. Default: '!!', which prevents the user from logging in with a
#   password.
#
# @param password_max_age
#   Maximum number of days a password may be used before it must be changed.
#   Allows any integer from `0` to `99999`. See the
#   [`user`](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/types/user.html#user-attribute-password_max_age)
#   resource.
#
# @param purge_sshkeys
#   Whether keys not included in sshkeys should be removed from the user. If
#   purge_sshkeys is true and sshkeys is an empty array, all SSH keys will be
#   removed from the user.
#
# @param purge_user_home
#   Whether to force recurse remove user home directories when removing a user.
#   Defaults to false.
#
# @param salt
#   This is the 32-byte salt used to generate the PBKDF2 password used in OS X.
#   This field is required for managing passwords on OS X >= 10.8.
#
# @param shell
#   Manages the user shell.
#
# @param sshkey_custom_path
#   Custom location for ssh public key file.
#
# @param sshkey_group
#   Specifies the group of the sshkey file
#
# @param sshkey_owner
#   Specifies the owner of the sshkey file
#
# @param sshkeys
#   An array of SSH public keys associated with the user. These should be
#   complete public key strings that include the type, content and name of the
#   key, exactly as it would appear in its id_*.pub file, or with an optional
#   options string preceding the other components, as it would appear as an
#   entry in an authorized_keys file. Must be an array.
#
#   Examples:
#
#   - ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1y... bob@example.com
#
#   - from="myhost.example.com,192.168.1.1" ssh-rsa AAAAQ4ng... bob2@example.com
#
#   Note that for multiple keys, the name component (the last) must be unique.
#
# @param system
#   Specifies if you want to create a system account.
#
# @param uid
#   Specifies the user's uid number. Must be specified numerically.
